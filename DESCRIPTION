Description: Implementation of split and dividend adjustment alternatives
    to the standard dividend adjustment provided by quantmod/Yahoo.
    It provides functions to remove the split adjustments
    from dividends. It provides two ways to include splits and dividends
    with price data (raw and reinvested) complementary to the adjusted
    values from Yahoo and quantmod. The raw adjustment assumes that
    assumes that dividends are added to your value and splits alters
    the number of shares you hold. The reinvested adjustment assumes
    that dividends and splits alter the number of shares you hold.
