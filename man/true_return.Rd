\title{Compute period returns as value change plus dividends.}
\usage{
true_return(true_value_data, period = "monthly")
}
\arguments{
\item{true_value_data}{A \code{data.table} including columns \code{index, close, trueshares, truedividends}.
The \code{index} column must be a valid type for \code{xts} indexing. Multi-symbol data
is not supported.}

\item{period}{A string indicating a granularity. See quantmod::periodReturn.}
}
\value{
An \code{xts} object ordered by the \code{index} column granulated to period. The
returns are calculated as close to close values multiplied by trueshares to account for
splits and adding in dividends over the period. Note that a dividend on date t in Yahoo
data is only paid to those holding at the close on date t-1. Therefore, there a dividend
on date t for which t is also the period start will be recorded in the period ending on date
t, not the next period starting on t. In particular, daily returns include a dividend on
date t in the return from t-1 to t, recorded as the return on date t.

Note that daily true returns for one week do not simply convert to weekly returns as prod(1+r).
Each day the basis for return is the close, but the return comes from the following close
plus dividends. Those dividends are not included in the basis for the following day.
